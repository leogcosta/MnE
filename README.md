###Aboot MnE
the app is going to be optimized for iPhone, it'll make use of HTML5's manifest and WebSQL capabilities to allow the app to work offline and sync once it's online

###Note from Moe
if you are going to deploy the app and you have a couple of bucks to spare, you can use *better* tools to get the most out of the app, i **personally** prefer
- [PHP](http://php.net) -> [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - for obvious reasons
- [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) -> [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) - if you like your sanity
- [Apache](http://apache.org) -> [Nginx](http://nginx.org)

i am *forced* to use *those* tools because of the hosting budget i have, i could have EASLY deployed it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) but i can't, because the app **MUST** run under SSL which obviously isn't free, even for self-signed certificates which is a bummer!

###PS
Luke, use the Fork
